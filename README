#To create the boot image sd_mmc_bootstream.raw from the kernel zImage:

# set environment variables
. ./envinit.sh

# ensure that kernel zImage is copied to the imx-bootlets directory
# run make in the imx-bootlets directory
make

# you should now have a sd_mmc_bootstream.raw image that you can dd 
# into the boot partition of the SD card
